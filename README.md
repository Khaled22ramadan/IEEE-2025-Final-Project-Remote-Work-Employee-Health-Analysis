# IEEE-2025-Final-Project-Remote-Work-Employee-Health-Analysis
This repository showcases the final project for the IEEE 2025 season,
* submitted by `Khaled Ramadan, Head of Committee`.

# ðŸ“Š Power BI Analysis: Project Overview
  This Power BI project analyzes the health impacts of different work arrangements (Remote, Hybrid, Onsite). The analysis is based on a 2025 survey dataset covering employee demographics, work habits, and self-  reported health metrics.

### The interactive dashboard explores key connections between work arrangement and:

    Mental Health Status (Anxiety, Burnout, Stress)
    
    Physical Health Issues (Back Pain, Eye Strain, etc.)
    
    Work-Life Balance & Social Isolation
    
    Trends across different industries, job roles, and regions.

Objective: To visualize how remote and hybrid work models correlate with employee well-being and identify key trends for a healthier, more productive workforce.
