# üìä Power BI Analysis: Project Overview
This Power BI project analyzes the health impacts of different work arrangements (Remote, Hybrid, Onsite).  
The analysis is based on a 2025 survey dataset covering employee demographics, work habits, and self-reported health metrics.

### The interactive dashboard explores key connections between work arrangement and:
- Mental Health Status (Anxiety, Burnout, Stress)  
- Physical Health Issues (Back Pain, Eye Strain, etc.)  
- Work-Life Balance & Social Isolation  
- Trends across different industries, job roles, and regions  

**Objective:** To visualize how remote and hybrid work models correlate with employee well-being and identify key trends for a healthier, more productive workforce.

## A Guide to Employee Well-being: Addressing Common Health Concerns

This guide provides practical advice for managing the common mental and physical health issues often identified in our analysis and faced in the modern workplace.

### 1. Managing Mental Health Challenges
*(PTSD, Anxiety, Burnout, Depression, ADHD)*

* **Seek Professional Support:** Consulting a therapist or mental health professional is a sign of strength. Check if your company offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for confidential, often free, support.

* **Set Clear Boundaries:** Establish a hard stop to your workday. Disconnecting fully by turning off notifications is essential for mental recovery and preventing burnout.

* **Communicate Effectively:** If you feel comfortable, speak with your manager or HR about your workload or specific stressors. A solution may be as simple as adjusting tasks, shifting deadlines, or clarifying expectations.

* **Practice Mindfulness & Organization:**
    * Take short, regular breaks throughout the day to clear your mind.
    * Use organizational tools like calendars, to-do lists, or project management apps to manage tasks and reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed.

### 2. Mitigating Physical Health Problems
*(Back, Shoulder, Neck, Wrist Pain & Eye Strain)*

* **Optimize Your Workspace Ergonomics:**
    * **Posture:** Adjust your chair so your feet are flat on the floor and your lower back is supported. Your knees should be at about a 90-degree angle.
    * **Monitor:** Position your screen directly in front of you, at or just below eye level, to keep your neck in a neutral, relaxed position.
    * **Wrists:** Ensure your wrists remain straight and neutral when typing. Consider an ergonomic keyboard and mouse for better support.

* **Incorporate Regular Movement:**
    * Stand up, stretch, and walk around for a few minutes every hour to relieve muscle tension and improve circulation.
    * **For Eye Strain (The 20-20-20 Rule):** Every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break to look at something 20 feet (about 6 meters) away. This helps reduce digital eye strain.

* **Consult a Professional:** Do not ignore chronic pain. If discomfort persists, see a doctor or a physical therapist for an accurate diagnosis and a personalized treatment plan.

# üöÄ Implications for Stakeholders
- **Workload & Hours:** Employees average 50 hours per week ‚Üí contributes to high physical and mental health issues. Reducing hours and promoting breaks is critical.  
- **Targeted Support:** Certain roles (QA, Consultants, Research Scientists, DevOps) and industries (Technology, Education, Healthcare) need tailored wellness programs.  
- **Gender Considerations:** Women report more health issues but better balance; men report more isolation ‚Üí initiatives should address both.  
- **Remote Work Challenges:** Remote work offers flexibility but leads to higher burnout and isolation ‚Üí more support and social connection opportunities are needed.  
- **Regional Differences:** Asia and Oceania show better scores; Africa and South America need focused intervention strategies.
